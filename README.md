# Machine Learning in Games
UNC Comp 585 Honors Project

At the moment, the repository contains a complete, if rather boring, game. It runs on python 3.5 and [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news). Running the python script game.py will run the game and it will close when you close the window or when only one actor remains.

## Controls
Arrow keys to move, left click to shoot towards the cursor. Moving and shooting cost energy which you can see in the top left corner.

## Basic Documentation

### rules.py
Rules contains a number of useful utility functions and a dictionary that holds all of the current constant 'rules' of the game. This makes it easy to manipulate broad contraints.
