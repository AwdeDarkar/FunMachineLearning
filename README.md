# Machine Learning in Games
UNC Comp 585 Honors Project

At the moment, the repository contains a complete, if rather boring, game. It runs on python 3.5 and [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news). Running the python script game.py will run the game and it will close when you close the window or when only one actor remains. Currently, controls are mapped to the arrow keys to move and a mouse click to fire a projectile.

## Basic Documentation

### rules.py
Rules contains a number of useful utility functions and a dictionary that holds all of the current constant 'rules' of the game. This makes it easy to manipulate broad contraints.
